## Selected Projects

- [AI Game Agent](https://github.com/adanhammod/pawn-game)  
  A game-playing AI agent built using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient decision-making.

- [Autonomous Drone Simulation](https://github.com/moataz189/real_time_system-project)
  <br>Collaborated with another student to develop an autonomous drone simulation in Python, using the GAZEBO simulator for the 3D environment, YOLOv7 for object detection, and ROS2 for inter-process communication.nProgrammed the drone to complete a complex mission: navigate to a predefined starting point, detect a specific object (a chair), and perform a precise, safe landing. Enabled real-time input adjustments, significantly improving the drone’s adaptability to dynamic environmental changes.
